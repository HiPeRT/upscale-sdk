.SH DESCRIPTION
.B boxer
is a tool that allows
to statically extracts the task dependency graph (tdg) of a OpenMP program.
It takes as input a json file generated by mercurium,
where all the data dependences and control structures
that affect tasks are specified.
It takes this information and expand all the control structures,
and meanwhile
it also duplicates the task associated to this structures.
When all the expansion is done,
then the expressions associated to dependences are evaluated,
discarding all the dependences which expressions are false.

generated a task.

Print all the nodes in the output, not only the tasks.
.TP

Print graph with the information about every step of expansion.
.TP
.BI \-o " output "
Output file where output TDG is saved.
By default it prints the TDG to standard output.
If the output is saved into a file
and the
.B \- x
option is used
